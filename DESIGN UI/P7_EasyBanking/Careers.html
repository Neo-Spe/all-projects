      <h1>Career definition</h1>
      <p>
        The word "career" usually has two definitions or meanings. "Career" is
        often used to refer to a profession, occupation, trade or vocation. A
        career could define what you do for a living and range from those that
        require extensive training and education to those you can perform with
        only a high school diploma and a willingness to learn. A career could
        mean working as a doctor, lawyer, teacher, carpenter, veterinary
        assistant, electrician, cashier, teacher or hairstylist. Career has
        another definition as well, though. It also refers to the progress and
        actions you have taken throughout the working years of your life,
        especially as they relate to your occupation. It is comprised of the
        different jobs you have held, titles you have earned and work you have
        accomplished over a long period of time. When viewed in this context, a
        career includes everything related to your career development, including
        your choice or profession and advancement. Your single career could
        include a variety of different paths.

      <h1>Types of career paths</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Multiple unrelated jobs:</h2>
          <p>
            Your career could be made up of multiple jobs that are unrelated to
            one another. For example, you could work as a sales associate in a
            retail environment, then as a server in a restaurant and then as a
            receptionist in a veterinary clinic. Because each job is vastly
            different than the next, there is no way to predict what your next
            position will be. Because they have very little in common, you may
            not see significant pay increases from one to the next or
            significant increases in responsibility.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Advancing within one occupation:</h2>
          <p>
            This path involves advancing in the same occupation, whether you
            work for the same organization or at different establishments. For
            example, if you are working as a cashier, you could eventually be
            moved to a customer service position where you operate a cash
            register but also handle customer service issues. Eventually, you
            could be moved to a head cashier position, supervising the other
            cashiers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Advancing in the same industry but not occupation:</h2>
          <p>
            This path involves staying in the same industry, but not necessarily
            the same occupation. For example, if your goal is to be a manager at
            a restaurant, you could start out as a dish washer, then move to a
            server position, then head server or assistant manager and
            eventually manager.
