      <b>The Most Lucrative Skill To Learn</b> <br />
      Hello,
      <p>
        I want to speak to your consciences on this subject matter, listen NO
        MATTER HOW CONFUSED YOU ARE IN LIFE LEARN A TECH SKILL. because the
        things you learn today is only bound to improvement,you are not going to
        start afresh because its the same thing all over the world, if you are
        learning CODING IN NIGERIA,You have known it is you have known it .
        <br />
        <br />
        Another reason why its important for you to learn (ICT) is their is work
        for every kind of (ICT) knowledge, you cannot be a guru in ICT and be
        jobless its not possible unless you choose to be like that or you are
        limited by your mindsets because thats the only thing which has the
        power to limit your destiny,thats why we have to be very much aware of
        what we think in our minds. its good to wish but it doesn't end
        there,you need to put it into action what you are wishing.
        <br /><br />
        I want to be a pilot is a good dream but you have never taken actions to
        substantiate it you will die of having malaria dreams and you will not
        move above the level you are.
        <br /><br />
        To change a man is the hardest thing to do but the easiest way to change
        the man is by Changing His information with that alone you have
        succeeded in Changing his entire being. Just as SATAN doesn't attack
        one's FAITH but the INFORMATION THE FAITH IS BUILT ON.So it's when you
        want to change a MAN from been IDLE to utilizing His every God giving
        Time. The last but not the list there are one thousand and one million
        opportunities under information communication technology but it's the
        willingness and perseverance are lacking in most of our youths today.
        <br /><br />
        NOTE:: In ICT you can be in a remote village and be working in America
        and you will be paid in dollars with that you don't need to travel
        outside the country but its your choice.no knowledge is a waste under
        information communication technology
      </p>

    <h2>CATEGORY OF TESTIMONIES</h2>
    <p>
      This is all about people who have utilized just opportunity embedded in
      information communication technology(I.C.T) Their are various field in
      this OIL WELL that people are not taking serious because of our nefarious
      nature.and coupled with rhe annoying characters of some of our youths.A
      youth of this country prefers to look neat and beg all through out the day
      other than him bending down to learn a course even if its not (ICT),But
      thats the only job that has a kind of live Relevance because once a person
      knows what He/She is doing in this Noble field he has Made it in life.

      it.i i must not forget my <em>teacher <b>RASTA</b></em> whom out of his a
      million knowledge took time to put me through under the auspices of

      I have been wandering like an Aramean in until i stumbled on the
      inspirational article of this great site,which shook me to my marrows of
      what i can do under information communication technology.

      I'm doing this with a motivation that whatever a <b>Man</b> can do
      <b>Woman</b> can do better meanwhile it was tedious in the beginning but i
      never relented and i keep pushing not minding how hectic it's as i journey
      through it.in the class of 0ver 550 pupil's we are only two ladies in the
      class,one advantage we had is we are beautiful and guys like women so we
      used the opportunity to be taught by professionals in the in the
      class.thanks i am not beautiful for nothing . <br /><br />

      I'm an auto-mobile rewire but i took this step because my work isn't
      coming steady and i don't want to dull my self so i have to try new
      dimensions.and i can boldly tell people that am no more an electrician .Am
      grateful to God almighty who willed it and i actionalized it.

      <b class="story">Anonymous</b> <br />
      I am somebody who out of my inquisitive nature fell into the hands of
      wrong friends ,who introduced me to internet fraud,the way things were
      going is a kind of cunning and funny at the same Time,at a point i notice
      that my friends doesn't go out with their phones but me anywhere i go with
      my phone,I ran out of luck when i stroke a deal worth over 2 million, I
      thought that's how it works until detectives of Economy and Financial
      Crimes Commission caught me,i was charged to court convicted and sentenced
      to 6 months in prison with heavy payola from friends.after my serving in
      the correctional centre. remembering that when one is coming from the
      gheto he doesn't need to fumble i choose to be a programmer. which i began
      the process while in correctional centre today i have made over the
      rubbish amount that led me to an un-warranted place.While i was IN i
      regretted my action,Because my <b>MOM</b> will kill me if she get to know
      that i have committed such crime of stealing .Because its stealing no
      matter what people may call it to look good .
