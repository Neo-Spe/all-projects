      I do NOT release these programs so that you "the End-user" can benefit
      from it in terms of using software or any other of these releases without
      buying the required licenses. R@1n, however, believes that everyone should
      have the option to test and backup their program and be able to run it
      without any problems. Further, I do NOT in any way condone the spreading
      of this program, in other words I do NOT spread the releases to any
      websites, P2P networks or any other public available location. I urge that
      this releases should not be spread like that at all. I R@1n has nothing to
      do with the distribution of these program, it is all done by third
      parties. As such, and according to the laws where the individuals of i
      reside, it is not my responsibility what others decides to do with these
      releases. However, let it be said quite clearly: "I DO NOT in any way
      condone the selling or redistribution of these program, this was NEVER my
      intention." R@1n does NOT take any responsibility of computer-loss or any
      data-errors that may occur from using these program. Keep in mind that you
      are using a third party solution to something we did not develop in the
      first place. Do note that the usage of these program are legal in most
      countries outside the United States, IF and ONLY IF you own a full copy of
      the program - then you may use these program for backup purposes, and only
      that. It remains to be seen how affected you are of the End User License
      Agreements (EULAs). They can't supersede domestic laws, remember that.
      According to the "DMCA ACT" in the Unites States, you have no rights to
      circumvent a copy protection. Beware, they will punish you harder than if
      you stole the shrinkwrapped software in a mall. Though R@1n's base of
      operation does not reside in the Unites States, and thus I am NOT bound to
      the US legislations like: * No Electronic Theft Act * Digital Millenium
      Copyright Act * The Patriot Act * "other US legislations" You should
      ALWAYS buy the software that you do use. This Software NOT encourage
      piracy, which is an act UNLAWFUL, as well as being a lack of respect
      towards those who dedicate time and effort to the development of
      applications. I do not assume liability for incorrect use, that is NOT
      dedicated to a vision for informational or educational study. With this I
      can tell you that I dedicate myself to NOT piracy in any way, I care only
      to share and study all forms of system and evasion. I disagree, in any
      form, software piracy and are NOT responsible for a eventale inappropriate
      or illegal use. By using these program you automatically agree to the
      written agreement above, and thus the responsibility regarding whatever
      you are affected by any EULAs is with YOU and YOU only. Thanks to: QAD,

    <h4>NIGERIAN IS IN SORRY STATE.</h4>

    <h6>By Administrator,Emmanuel Chinedu .O.</h6>
    <p class="ourm">
      It’s an acknowledged fact that Nigeria’s Health sector is in shambles and
      this issue aside the energy problem and other related developmental issues
      need to be address and fix as quickly as possible by the new
      administration under president Yar’Adua PDP led government. In many places
      in Nigeria , our Hospitals especially primary Health centres are far away
      from where people live and some are with expired drugs , dilapidated
      structures, corrugated roots , covered with cobwebs and in many places,
      have become inhabitants of domestic animals. From research, in some
      tertiary and secondary health centres , ordinary water supply are not
      available , patient relatives have resort to buying water in jerry cans
      and health workers have to wait endlessly for essential drugs and
      disposable gloves faced with irregular power supply . According to 2003
      National Demographic Health survey , our immunisation coverage is put at
      13% and that led to some of the reasons why some Nigeria children are
      dying everyday of preventable illness. Also, the rate at which women are
      dying of preventable and avoidable complications of pregnancies across the
      entire nation is alarming . Nigeria accounts for 10% of the global
      estimate of maternal death , even though according to World Health
      Organisation, our population only accounts of 2% of the world population,
      no wonder why our train qualified Doctors and Nurses are all eager to
      leave the country and travel abroad. REASONS BEHIND THE BRAIN DRAIN {
      MIGRATION OF HEALTH WORKERS ABROAD} It is sad to note that Nigeria and
      indeed Africa are loosing their experienced Health workers to developed
      countries as a result of Neglect of their Health sectors and particularly
      in Nigeria , mismanagement of resources, lack of priority , lack of
      respect for human lives by our leaders , low wages , poor motivation,
      persistent shortages of basic medical supplies, poor working conditions,
      outdated equipments, lack of efficient and effective coordination, limited
      career opportunities and above all , economic reasons are among the most
      important factors responsible for this brain drain. REFORMING THE HEALTH
      SECTOR Reforming the health sector is the responsibility of the Federal
      Ministry of Health. The National Health Bill should be revisited by the
      National Assembly while the introduction of National Health insurance
      scheme { NHIS} by the past administration is welcome by Nigerians.
      However, it has not been efficiently coordinated, handled and effectively
      implemented as those assigned for this project, lack the will, vigour,
      commitment and aggressiveness and this writer urge the government to
      create conducive enabling environment to allow qualified experienced
      Nigerians in Diaspora to fully participate and assist in a manner that
      will yield positive result for the nation. While most Nigerians will argue
      that the debate and struggle about reforming and improving Health care
      Delivery system in Nigeria should not be left alone to politicians and
      their cronies, but should involve Health professionals both at home and
      abroad, The media, to educate the masses of their rights and
      responsibilities and advice the masses not to abuse the system and ensure
      equity prevails. Today, in Nigeria, basic health care is becoming very
      difficult and expensive to obtain by average common people in the country
      and government expenditure on health as a population of the total spend on
      healthy as a whole is small. Although, some significant steps have been
      taken by the past administration, president Yar’Adua administration has to
      give Nigeria people the 21st century comprehensive efficient and effective
      health care delivery system. Management of health services in Nigeria
      should be decentralised with emphasis on the village Health care system .
      There should be increased access to care services by making primary Health
      care available to all Nigeria in respective of status, religion and sex.
      Nigerians deserves a good health care delivery system and the government
      should ensure the availability of safe and good quality essential drugs
      and NAFDAC as a regulatory body should be commended in this area. The
      development of a National Health information system should be encouraged
      to facilitate Health planning and management. Disease prevention has to be
