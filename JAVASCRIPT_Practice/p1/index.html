    <h5>WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT ?</h5>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
      implement complex features on web pages. It is one of the core
      technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS1. JavaScript is
      used to create interactive effects within web browsers2. It is a
      lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language
      with first-class functions3. While it is most well-known as the scripting
      language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as
      Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat3.

    <h2>Front End Developer:</h2>
    <p>
      As a front-end developer, I possess a strong command of HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript, enabling me to bring designs to life and create intuitive and
      responsive user interfaces. I am experienced in working with modern
      frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, allowing me to build
      dynamic and interactive web applications. With an eye for detail and a
      commitment to writing clean and maintainable code, I ensure that the
      websites I develop are both aesthetically pleasing and performant across
      various devices and browsers.
